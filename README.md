# Real-Time Violence Detection using Kaggle and Python

## Overview
This project aims to create a real-time violence detection system using Kaggle, Python, and deep learning techniques. We will use a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify video frames in real-time as either violent or non-violent.

## Prerequisites
- **Kaggle Account**: You'll need a Kaggle account to run notebooks on the Kaggle platform. [Sign up here](https://www.kaggle.com/account/register).

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Kaggle Environment
1. Go to the Kaggle website and log in to your account.
2. Navigate to the Kaggle Kernels section and click on "New Notebook."
3. Choose a Python environment with GPU support. This will enable you to train and run deep learning models more efficiently.

## Step 2: Data Collection
You will need a dataset of violent and non-violent video frames for training and testing your model. Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to use the dataset.

## Step 3: Create a Jupyter Notebook
Create a new Jupyter Notebook on Kaggle and name it something like "Violence_Detection_Real_Time.ipynb".

## Step 4: Import Libraries
In your Jupyter Notebook, start by importing the necessary libraries, including OpenCV for video frame capture, a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., VGG16 or ResNet), and TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf  # or import torch
from tensorflow.keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16, preprocess_input, decode_predictions
```
## Step 5: Load Pre-trained Model

Load a pre-trained model that has been previously trained on a violence detection dataset. Replace `'model_path'` with the path to your model file.

```python
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model_path')
```
## Step 6: Real-Time Video Capture and Classification

Capture video frames in real-time using OpenCV and apply the model for classification. This code captures video from your computer's webcam.

```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 for the default webcam

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Preprocess the frame (resize, normalize, etc.)
    processed_frame = preprocess_frame(frame)
    
    # Perform inference using your loaded model
    prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(processed_frame, axis=0))
    
    # You can add logic here to display the prediction on the frame or take some action based on the prediction.
    
    # Display the frame
    cv2.imshow('Real-Time Violence Detection', frame)
    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
## Step 7: Customize and Enhance

Customize the code as needed for your specific dataset and requirements. You can add logic to display bounding boxes around violent actions or to save detected frames.

Here are some customization ideas:
- **Bounding Boxes**: Implement code to draw bounding boxes around violent actions in the video frames to provide visual feedback.
- **Logging and Alerts**: Integrate logging and alerting mechanisms to keep track of violent events or notify relevant parties in real-time.
- **Frame Saving**: Save frames where violence is detected for later analysis or reporting.
- **Thresholding**: Adjust classification threshold values to fine-tune the model's sensitivity and specificity.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Implement real-time analytics to gather statistics on violence detection over time.

Feel free to explore enhancements that suit your project's goals and requirements.

Remember to test and validate your customizations thoroughly to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your violence detection system.
## Step 8: Run the Notebook

Run the Jupyter Notebook on Kaggle. Make sure to save your notebook as you make changes and improvements.

1. Open the Kaggle notebook you created in Step 3 ("Violence_Detection_Real_Time.ipynb").
2. Execute the cells in your notebook to initialize the environment, load the model, and start the real-time violence detection process.
3. As the notebook runs, you'll see real-time video frames processed by your model.
4. If you customized the code in Step 7, ensure that your customizations are functioning as intended.
5. Monitor the notebook's execution for any errors or issues.
6. Save your notebook regularly as you make improvements and optimizations.

Once you are satisfied with the performance and functionality of your real-time violence detection system, you can consider deploying it in your desired environment or integrating it into your application.

Remember to document any noteworthy findings or insights from running your notebook.
